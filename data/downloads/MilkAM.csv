See LFH0009.
The amino acid sequence of the LfcinH peptide isolated in this study shows that the peptide linkage between Ala11 and Val12 is intact and that the peptide obtained by pepsin digestion is 49 amino acids long, whereas the LfcinH sequence reported previously (LFH0009) is 47 residues. It is possible that the previously reported peptide sequence resulted from extended proteolysis or a difference in the source of the pepsin used for digestion (Citation: 1).","Not determined","","GRRRRSVQWCAVSQPEATKCFQWQRNMRKVRGPPVSCIKRDSPIQCIQA;

Four of these peptides, LFH0003, LFH0016, LFH0026 and LFH0045, were active against all of the 9 bacterial strains examined, while LFH0002 and LFH0059 exhibited strain specific activity (Citation: 6).
In order to find an optimal peptide length within the peptide sequence 14–31 (LFH0011) with regard to antimicrobial activity, amino acid residues were removed one by one, starting from the N-terminal end. The most active peptides were the ones corresponding to residues LFH0014, LFH0021, LFH0027, and LFH0030. The trends of increasing antimicrobial activity from sequence 14–31 (LFH0011) to 17–31 (LFH0014) and decreasing from sequence 20–31 (LFH0029) to 22–31 (LFH0055) were statistically significant (Citation : 5).
Antibacterial activities for the linear (LFH0045) and the branched, dimeric (LFH0050), tetrameric (LFH0051), octameric (LFH0052) and hexadecemeric (LFH0053) MAPs were tested against P.aeruginosa. LFH0051, LFH0052 and LFH0053 exhibited strong antibacterial activity while LFH0045 and LFH0050 did not, up to a peptide concentration of about 200 mm. The peptide with the highest antibacterial activity was LFH0053 (Citation: 7).
LFH0054, corresponding to the loop region of human lactoferricin (LFH0009), LFH0045, corresponding to the positively charged portion of the loop region and LFH0079, corresponding to the uncharged portion of the loop region were synthetised and tested for their antimicrobial activity. LFH0054 and LFH0045 exhibited potent anti-bacterial activity against E. coli whereas LFH0079 had no activity (Citation: 2).
The difference between the activities of LFH0054 and LFH0045 against S. aureus could be explained by differences in peptide size, allowing uptake of HLP 2 rather than HLP 1, but it is more likely to be due to differences in flexibility and conformation if the peptide binds to the peptidoglycan. This would also explain why LFH0048 still has activity against S. aureus (Citation: 1).
In the presence of LPS, LFH0045 and LFH0048 were found to bind and adopt a beta-strand conformation rather than an alpha-helix. Furthermore, there is a time-dependent association of peptide that results in an ordered formation of peptide aggregates. The rate of interpeptide association was far greater in LFH0045-LPS than in LFH0048-LPS, which was consistent with the lag phase observed on the killing curves. These results allow us to propose a mechanism by which LFH0045 folds and self-assembles at the outer membrane surface before exerting its activity (Citation: 3).
LFH0045 was found to act at the cell membrane, causing complete loss of membrane potential after 10 min and of membrane integrity within 30 min, with irreversible damage to the cell as shown by rapid loss of viability. It causes membrane disruption of the outer membrane, resulting in lysis, and that structural considerations are important for antibacterial activity (Citation: 1).

Both 3D models for LFH0045 and LFb0109 showed that the beta-strand is centred between the aromatic residues giving both side chains the same orientations. The displacement towards the N-terminus observed for the b-strand in LFH0045, compared with its central location in LFB0109, could be less favourable to membrane interaction and therefore responsible for the decrease in activity. Such a model suggests for LFH0009 a mechanism similar to the one observed for LFB0086, where the absence of long-range interaction, present in lactoferrin, destabilises the first alpha helix, as observed in solution and, upon interaction with the membrane, could result in the formation of a beta-strand, as observed in the presence of LPS. The location of the beta-strand in relation to the positive charges, seems to define the efficiency of the activity of the peptide and may explain the difference in activity obtained between both peptides (Citation 4).","Antibacterial","{Gram-positive: Active against} Staphylococcus aureus CCUG 1800 at 25 µg/ml.

LFB0012 shares structural homology with human lactoferricin (LFH0009) both peptides contain two subfragments linked by a  disulfide bridge, and both have similar origins in the native molecule (1 to 47 and 1 to 48 for human and bovine peptides, respectively). LFB0012 was four times less active than LFB0092, even though LFB0012 contained the complete sequence of LFB0092. Others studies found that the activity of LFH0009 was nine times lower than that of LFB0084. It may be speculated that, in the larger peptides (LFH0009 and LFB0012), sequences flanking the active loop (residues 20 to 37 and 19 to 36 in human and bovine peptides, respectively) hinder effective interaction with the bacterial surface. With LFB0092, a molecule with smaller flanking sequences, such interference would be minimized (Citation: 1).","Antibacterial","{Gram-negative:}Escherichia coli strain 1 (MIC=17 µM)","APRKNVRWCTISQPEWFKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAFA/LECIRA;

To determine whether disruption of the cyclic structure of LFB0091 would have an effect on its antimicrobial activity, the peptide was either reduced in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol or cleaved with CNBr. Purified fragments were assayed for their antibacterial activities. The antibacterial activity of the subfragment 1 (LFB0017) was not as potent as that of intact peptide and subfragment 2 (LFB0119) had weak antibacterial activity suggesting that each subfragment contains an element that must be brought into proximity with the other to achieve the potent activity displayed by intact lactoferricin. Determination of the absolute nature of the peptide’s antibacterial character  would involve structural studies and further chemical modification, initially directed at its positively charged residues (Citation: 1).","Antibacterial","{Gram-positive:}Listeria monocytogenes NCTC 7973 (MIC=10 µM), Bacillus cereus ACM 446 (MIC=20 µM)

LFB0031 is a 15-residue linear antimicrobial peptide derived from bovine lactoferricin (LFB0084), which has antimicrobial activity similar to that of the intact 25-residue disulfide-cyclized peptide. This supports the observation that the antimicrobial potency of LfcinB does not require the single disulfide bond (Citation:1).
This peptide is used to study the structure–function relationship of LFB and the importance of the 2 Trp residues (Citation:1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12).
An alignment analysis using MegAlign software, Clustal method, showed that LFP0001, LFH0022, LFM0001 and LAG0002 had similarity indexes with LFB0031 of 33%, 40%, 53% and 67%, respectively. The antibacterial activities reveal that LFB0031 was remarkably more active than the other lactoferricin peptides. It is noteworthy that LAG0003 was the only lactoferricin peptide besides LFB with a measurable MIC value against E. coli (Citation 6).
Synthetic peptides derived from human and bovine lactoferricin, as well as tritrpticin sequences, were assayed for antimicrobial activity against wild-type Escherichia coli and LPS mutant strains. Antimicrobial activity was only obtained with peptides derived from the bovine lactoferricin sequence (LFH0016, LFH0017, LFH0018, LFH0019 and LFH0020) and peptides corresponding to chimeras of human (LFH0081 and LFH0082) and bovine sequences (LFB0031, LFB0041 and LFB0046). None of the peptides corresponding to different regions of native human lactoferricin showed any antimicrobial activity. The results underline the importance of the content of tryptophan and arginine residues, and the relative location of these residues for antimicrobial activity (Citation: 10).","Antibacterial, antifungal","{Gram-positive:}Lactobacillus brevis CECT216 (MIC=25 mg/ml), Lactobacillus hilgardii CECT4659 (MIC=200 mg/ml), Pediococcus damnosus CECT4693 (MIC=6.3 mg/ml), Oenococcus oeni (MIC=200 mg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC=48-50 µM), Bacillus subtilis CECT498 (MIC=16 µM)

The results underline the importance of the content of tryptophan and arginine residues, and the relative location of these residues for antimicrobial activity (Citation: 2).","Antibacterial","{Gram-negative:}Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (MIC=25 µM), Escherichia coli K12 D21e19 (MIC=160 µM), Escherichia coli K12 D21e7 (MIC=160 µM), Escherichia coli K12 W3110 (MIC=320 µM), Escherichia coli K12 D21 (MIC=320 µM), Escherichia coli K12 D21f1 (MIC=640 µM), Escherichia coli K12 D21f2 (MIC=640 µM), Escherichia coli MLK53 (MIC=320 µM), Escherichia coli MLK1067 (MIC=160 µM), Escherichia coli MLK986 (MIC=160 µM), Escherichia coli WA707 (MIC=320 µM), Escherichia coli WA834 (MIC=320 µM)

The cyclic bovin lactoferricin (LFB0086) and the linear lactoferricins of bovine (LFB0089), human (LFH0026), murine (LFM0020)and caprine (LAG0006) origin were synthesized and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Only Lf-cinB (LFB0086 and LFB0089) showed significant antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. We found that cyclic Lf-cin B (LFB0084; LFB0086) was more active than linear Lf-cin B (LFB0089) (Citation: 1). 
To investigate the peptide structure-biological activity relationships, bovine lactoferricin, its basic amino acid-rich region (LFB0109) and their analogues were synthesized . LFB0109 and its substituted peptides (LFB0112, LFB0113, LFB0114, LFB0115, LFB0116, LFB0117) also had similar antimicrobial activity while losing most of the hemolytic activities as compared to the long peptides (LFB0086 and LFB0090) (Citation: 2).
LFB0018, which consists of the N-terminal half of LFB0086, revealed the strongest anti-Candida cell activity. The  anti-Candida cell activity of LFB0086 was about one-third that of LFB0018. Whereas, LFB0118, which consists of the six amino residues near the N-terminus, revealed very weak anti-Candida cell activity. In addition, LFB0120, which consists of the C-terminal half of  bLF, exhibited only weak anti-Candida cell activity. Therefore, the main anti-Candida cell activity of bLF appears to exist in the N-terminal half and the activity was increased by discarding the C-terminal half (Citation: 3).","Antibacterial, antifungal","{Gram-positive:}Bacillus subtilis (MIC=6.3 µg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (MIC=30 µg/ml), Bacillus cereus FSAW 0303 (MIC=400 µg/ml), Bacillus subtilis FSAW 0320 (MIC=6.3 µg/ml), Listeria innocua FSAW 2305 (MIC=6.3 µg/ml), Listeria monocytogenes FSAW 2310 (MIC=6.3 µg/ml), Listeria monocytogenes FSAW 2325 (MIC=6.3 µg/ml)

LFB0012 shares structural homology with human lactoferricin (LFH0009) both peptides contain two subfragments linked by a  disulfide bridge, and both have similar origins in the native molecule (1 to 47 and 1 to 48 for human and bovine peptides, respectively). LFB0012 was four times less active than LFB0092, even though LFB0012 contained the complete sequence of LFB0092. Others studies found that the activity of LFH0009 was nine times lower than that of LFB0084. It may be speculated that, in the larger peptides (LFH0009 and LFB0012), sequences flanking the active loop (residues 20 to 37 and 19 to 36 in human and bovine peptides, respectively) hinder effective interaction with the bacterial surface. With LFB0092, a molecule with smaller flanking sequences, such interference would be minimized (Citation: 5).","Antibacterial","{Gram-positive:}Micrococcus flavus DSM 1790 (MIC=8 µM), Staphylococcus epidermidis CECT 231 (MIC=0.05 µM), Bacillus cereus ACM 446 (MIC=8 µM), Listeria monocytogenes NCTC 7973 (MIC=2 µM), Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 (MIC=16 µM)

Synthetic peptides derived from human and bovine lactoferricin, as well as tritrpticin sequences, were assayed for antimicrobial activity against wild-type Escherichia coli and LPS mutant strains. Antimicrobial activity was only obtained with peptides derived from the bovine lactoferricin sequence (LFH0016, LFH0017, LFH0018, LFH0019 and LFH0020) and peptides corresponding to chimeras of human (LFH0081 and LFH0082) and bovine sequences (LFB0031, LFB0041 and LFB0046). None of the peptides corresponding to different regions of native human lactoferricin showed any antimicrobial activity.

To determine whether disruption of the cyclic structure of LFB0091 would have an effect on its antimicrobial activity, the peptide was either reduced in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol or cleaved with CNBr. Purified fragments were assayed for their antibacterial activities. The antibacterial activity of the subfragment 1 (LFB0017) was not as potent as that of intact peptide and subfragment 2 (LFB0119) had weak antibacterial activity suggesting that each subfragment contains an element that must be brought into proximity with the other to achieve the potent activity displayed by intact lactoferricin.

Stepwise N-terminal truncation, starting with LFampin 261–284 (LFB0126) and truncated to 268–284 (LFB0149), did not result in drastic effects on candidacidal activity. Only after the removal of Trp268 and Lys269, resulting in LFampin 270–284, did a sharp drop in candidacidal activity occur, marked by a more than 12-fold decrease in the LC50 value (LFB0150).

Two lactoferrampin (LFampin) peptides derived from bovine lactoferrin were compared with respect to their bactericidal activities. LFampin  265–284 (LFB0131) killed a set of Gram-positive bacteria that were resistant to LFampin 268–284 (LFB0149). The presence of Asp-Leu-Ile did not  simply lead to an overall increased potency, since higher concentrations of LFampin 265–284 than LFampin 268–284 were needed to kill  the Gram-negative bacteria that were tested. The Asp-Leu-Ile sequence enhances the propensity of LFampin to adopt an a-helix, as  shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These results suggest that the helical conformation of the peptide is an important determinant  of the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria (Citation: 6).

The N1-domain contains besides lactoferricin a second stretch, designated lactoferrampin (LFampin), with features that are characteristic for antimicrobial peptides, i.e. the presence of positively charged residues as well as a hydrophobic domain which contains tryptophan, a residue that is involved in membrane insertion. This novel peptide showed a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that is not completely identical to that of bLF 17–30 (LFB0030). In addition, LFampin has no hemolytic activity in the antimicrobial working concentration (Citation: 1).

The innate immunity factor lactoferrin harbours two antimicrobial moieties, lactoferricin (LFB0084) and lactoferrampin (LFB0149), situated in close proximity in the N1 domain of the molecule. Most likely they cooperate in many of the beneficial activities of lactoferrin. To investigate whether chimerization of both peptides forms a functional unit we designed a chimerical structure containing lactoferricin  amino acids 17-30 (LFB0030) and lactoferrampin amino acids 265-284 (LFB0131). The bactericidal activity of this LFchimera was found to be drastically  stronger than that of the constituent peptides, as was demonstrated by the need for lower dose, shorter incubation time and less ionic  strength dependency (Citation: 1). 
By electron microscopy, a clear cellular damage was observed in bacteria after treatments with LFchimera and peptides, suggesting that interaction and membrane disruption are probably involved as a mechanism of action (Citation: 2).","Antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitical","{Gram-positive: Active against }Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA at 1µM, Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt (LC50=1.6 µM), Streptococcus sanguis SK4 (LC50=1.5 µM)

The peptide Ser(P)149k-casein-A(138–158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase Glu-C digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide Ser(P)149k-casein-A(138–158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart kcasein-A(138–158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. The synthetic Ser(P)149 k-casein-A(138–158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against S. mutans (MIC, 59 mg/ml [26 mM]). The nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity (Citation: 1).","Antibacterial","{Gram-positive:}Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt (MIC=0.06 mg/ml)

LAP0001 and LAP0003 peptides both interact with phospholipids, but only LAP0001 can incorporate into planar lipidic bilayers by forming voltage-dependent channels. The conductance levels indicate that channel formation may be achieved by association of 4 to 6 bundles of peptides according to the barrelstave model.

It was found that 12 carbon units (LFH0092) constitute the optimal acyl chain length, enhancing the antibacterial activity and binding of lipopolysaccharide by up to two orders of magnitude. Results of this antibacterial assay indicate that recombinant peptide (LFH0096) is functionally equal to the synthetically prepared peptide HLT2 (LFH0045) (citation 1).
